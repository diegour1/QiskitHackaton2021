# QiskitHackaton2021

In this project for the Qiskit Fall Fest Hackaton 2021, we show a quantum protocol to estimate the expected values of density matrices. This quantum protocol allows us to implement a supervised machine learning model called the Density Matrix Kernel Density Classification (DMKDC). We test the quantum circuit over a binary data set of images of 0s and 1s. In contrast to most quantum machine learning models which are based on pure states, our model can simulate mixed states.
